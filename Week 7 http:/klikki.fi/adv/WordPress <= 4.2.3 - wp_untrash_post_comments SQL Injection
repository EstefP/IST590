When going to reference https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/70128fe7605cb963a46815cf91b0a5934f70eff5
I see that there is 2 files wp-includes/post.php and wp-includes/version.php 
Going to the second reference it reports result of Pentesting that include 5 steps 
first being Wordpress <=4.2 where you find a comment on existing post 
open WP_<=_4.2_Unauthenticated_Stored_XSS.js and copy to javascript 
navigate to your desired WP site 
create a new comment on post and paste 
wait on administrator to approve you comment 
Next you will need Username Enumeration provided via HTTP GET Request for using author ID
Next will be finding user enuermation provided via Login Error Messages 
NExt you would vulnerability traversal and information exposure 
Lastly delete plugin path traversal/arbitrary file deletion 
Steps above come from reference https://github.com/harrystaley/CSCI4349_Week7_WpPentest/blob/master/readme.md
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2213, describes SQL injection vulnerability in wp_untrash_post_comments 
This flaw allows hackers to preform arbitrary SQL commands via a comment
